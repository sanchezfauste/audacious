These SVG files have been un-optimized to work around the following librsvg bug:
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=620923

Basically, older versions of librsvg can't parse an optimized path like
".123.456", they need it spelled out as "0.123 0.456".

An SVG file can be un-optimized by the following regex replacements:

Replace once:
    ([^0-9])\.
    \10\.

Replace until no longer found:
    ([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9|\.|-]+)
    \1\.\2 0\.\3

Replace once:
    www0
    www
